# Simply Spud

(Formerly Simply Potato)

======================

## About

Simply Spud is a StepMania/Outfox theme that focues on:
 * A balance of simplicity and stylistic flair
 * An intuitive menu design for casual players, with useful features for pro players

A fork of Simply Love SM5, it adds several layers of flair and polish while sharing some of the original's simplistic charm and most of its core features for pro players.

---

Current major changes:
  * Supports Outfox (formerly StepMania 5.3, for improved performance and new features)
  * Overhauled aesthetics - nearly every screen has more animation and stylistic flair
  * Overhauled play experience
   * [Improved style selection](https://i.imgur.com/9VP89ps.png) - Casual and ITG mode are now Beginner and Pro mode. FA+/StomperZ are still available in Pro mode.
   * [Overhauled Casual Mode](https://i.imgur.com/ttb5uz6.png) - now features a cover-flow style song list and improved difficulty selection
   * [Reworked Pro Mode] - More open and visually stylized song selection, separate difficulty selection
  * An optional potato-inspired visual style to go along with the other styles (hearts, arrows, thonk, etc)

Other useful features and tools for public cab operators:
  * Configurable song rating scales/group descriptions on the music wheel, can color song titles based on rating scale
  * Default songs for profileless players now affect *all* play modes
  * Can optionally auto-fail players at 30/51 miss combo (for players that walk away from the cab mid-song)
  * A News feature, to show configurable images in the attract mode loop and to players with memory cards
  * "Modfile" groups - Gives modfiles colored titles, and shows a warning to new players.
  * Tweaks to the attract loop, including demo play (set the songs to play by adding a course named "Simply-Potato-SM5")
  * Cab lighting test in the service menu
  * Many more easter eggs and bug fixes!
  
Do note that while the original Simply Love theme was translated into several languages, Simply Spud (at the moment at least) only has English translations for the new lines of text.


## Special Thanks
  * Thanks to skogaby for letting us know that Simply Spud is a much better name than Simply Potato
  * Thanks to quietly-turning, hurtpiggypig, and everyone else who helped with the original Simply Love themes for SM5 and SM3.95, directly or indirectly. Your help helped create the *de facto* Stepmania theme for multiple generations of dance game players, and no other theme I've seen has compared to the amount of polish and *love* that was put into the original themes.


## Requirements

You'll need to install [Project Outfox](https://projectoutfox.com/downloads), [StepMania 5.0.12](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.0.12), or [StepMania 5.1 beta](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/releases/tag/v5.1.0-b2) to use this theme.

Versions of StepMania older than 5.0.12 and StepMania 5.2 are not compatible.

#### Troubleshooting StepMania

If you are having trouble installing StepMania or getting it to run on your computer, please refer to StepMania's [FAQ](http://www.stepmania.com/faq/).  Additionally, you may find these links helpful for your given operating system:

  * **Windows** -  [This issue on GitHub](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania-site/issues/64) provides links to the needed DirectX and VS2013 redistributable packages.
  * **macOS** - If you are unable to open the dmg installer with an error like "No mountable file systems", you'll need to [update your copy of macOS](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/issues/1726) for the time being. If you are encountering the "No NoteSkins found" error, [this wiki page](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/Installing-on-macOS) provides a means of resolving it on your computer until it is properly fixed upstream.
  * **Linux** - It is more or less assumed that you will build your own executables if you are using Linux.  StepMania's GitHub wiki provides both a [list of dependencies](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/Linux-Dependencies) and some [instructions on compiling](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/Compiling-StepMania).
