The original score vocalization assets can be downloaded at
http://www.mediafire.com/file/mpsmto82d8diflr/Vocalize.zip

extract that zip to this folder and you'll be good to go!

(AFAIK, the numbers in each voice's default.lua are the lengths of each file)

Lines you should record to make your own:  
"Point"  
"Zero", "One", "Two", "Three", ... "Nine"  
"Ten", "Eleven", "Twelve", "Thirteen", ... "Nineteen"  
"Twenty", "Thirty", "Fourty", "Fifty", ... "Ninety"  
At least one line for quad stars
