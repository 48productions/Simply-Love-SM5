# Configuring News

News is an optional feature of Simply Spud that displays custom images during attract mode, optionally to players as well.

Use this to show info about new content, events, etc. Great for public cab usage!



## Making images

 - Transparent images are allowed - they're displayed over SP's shared "flying icons" background
